During this era, the alphabet had 24 letters. _I_ and _J_ were the same letter, as were _U_ and _V_: In each case, two graphs - two characters - could be used to write the same letter. 'V' for example was more often used to begin a word, with the 'u' form preferred for the body of the word. By default, Sharpie uses this 24 letter alphabet, but if your preferred transcription convention is to distinguish 26 characters, you can choose this too.
