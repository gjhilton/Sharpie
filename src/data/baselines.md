Show the approximate baseline of the characters (can be useful for distinguishing majuscule from minuscule).

{{BASELINE_TOGGLE}}

When enabled, a baseline appears across each character image. This can help distinguish between majuscule (uppercase) and minuscule (lowercase) forms, as minuscule characters typically sit on the baseline while majuscule characters may extend above it.
